# 1. Bloquer les vols
Thu Jan 30 - - Prof Makau Mutua - - It makes ZERO sense for @KenyaAirways to fly to China if Hong Kong — itself a part of China — has banned travel to Mainland China because of the deadly coronavirus.  Why invite a fatal epidemic 😷?  Even Russia has closed its border with China @JamesMacharia_ @MOH_Kenya
Thu Jan 30 - - Ndindi Nyoro - - We're organising huge demonstration to force Govt & Lazy CS Macharia to Cancel travels to China, Evacuate our people from China & Suspend flights by Kenya Airways to & from China following increasing Coronavirus deaths. Raila has bewitched these people#Dustbin2022#WaitituSpeaks

# 2. Citoyens kenyans bloqués à Wuhan + Guangzhou
Mon Jan 27 - - Robert Alai - - I am in touch with 85 Kenyans stuck in Wuhan. They aren’t getting help from the Kenyan embassy in Beijing. Sad!! @MOH_Kenya @ForeignOfficeKE can’t you help? Or you’d want some bribe? #CoronaVirus Most of these Kenyans are students in various colleges in Wuhan region.
<insérer exemple de guangzhou> (avis mitigés, certains disent de les ramener, d'autres disent nique notamment parce que le premier cas suspecté au Kenya était un passager qui venait de Guangzhou justement)
Tue Jan 28 - - BRAVIN YURI - - I haven't seen the government Caring to talk about the Kenyans who are in China amidst the Corona Virus outbreak. Are these people not important to Kenya? Several students are suffering in China & can only access one meal a day. Even online ordering of food has been cancelled. 🤔

Thu Feb 27 - - Boniface Mwangi - - Does Uhuru love this country because, if he did, no Chinese flight would be allowed to land in Kenya as long as the Coronavirus remains a threat. Our health system can’t handle a Coronavirus outbreak.  #coronaviruskenya pic.twitter.com/Yn6IkaqUi1
FRED THE RED 🔴 - - #coronaviruskenya😡 I don't understand why still there are flights from china coming to Kenya and the govt doesn't do a thing, am sure just 1 positive case of COVID 19  is enough to wipe out half the entire nation, given poor mechanisms of disaster preparedness
Wed Feb 26 - - Felix Regera - - This Video of China Southern Plane landing on JKIA breaks my hearts and makes me to kneel and Pray for Only God can help us! This Virus has shaken some of the mighty countries like Italy and France yet we are still joking about it! What wrong with Kenya???🤔🤔#coronaviruskenya pic.twitter.com/RSKM8yfVvA

Thu Feb 27 - - Victor Mochere - - I campaigned and queued for hours to vote for Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka. That was me minding the future on my country. Those who voted for Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto, you auctioned Kenya to corruption and now Coronavirus.#WajingaNyinyi #CoronavirusKenya
Thu Feb 27 - - Metropol TV Kenya - - Chinese planes allowed into Kenya, who is to blame in case of the COVID-19 outbreak?OgwangOmuga: We should blame all the way up to the President. Uhuru Kenyatta is playing with the lives of Kenyan people.#BusinessAM#coronavirusInkenya#UhuruKenyatta pic.twitter.com/yYdj9FwBo6
Fri Feb 28 - - Dr. Miguna Miguna - - The whole world EXCEPT KENYA is on lockdown because of the CORONAVIRUS pandemic. Responsible leaders are scrambling to PROTECT their citizens while Despot Uhuru Kenyatta plans to wipe Kenyans out and protect only his family, the Odingas, Mois and other cartels. #uhurumustgo
# 4. colère contre le gouvernement
Wed Feb 26 - - Lauren - - Dear Coronavirus,Any moment you will make an accidental entry into Kenya, kindly pay a visit to Parliament buildings and Statehouse.

Sat Feb 29 - - Vinny Tush - - While our TRASH Kenyan government is intentionally exposing us to COVID-19 by allowing 239 passengers from the epicenter of this deadly virus to land in Kenya and interact with us#uhurumustgo#Coronaviruske twitter.com/breakingavnews…
Fri Feb 28 - - NTV Kenya - - #Coronavirus: "The issue of self quarantine is laughable and a tragedy. The government is exposing Kenyans to the danger of getting the virus. We condemn the decision to allow Chinese to continue jetting in and out of Kenya." - Martha Karua pic.twitter.com/f4VtIBBHNL
# 5. avocado farmers
Thu Feb 13 - - The China Africa Project - - Kenya's avocado farmers are among the first casualties of the new COVID-19 slowdown in China-Africa trade. With all direct flights to China from Nairobi grounded, there's no way to get their perishable product to Chinese buyers. the-star.co.ke/business/kenya…
# 6. défaitisme
Thu Feb 27 - - Japheth Muuo - - China, a country with one of the best mechanisms for contingencies is struggling to contain this virus but Kenya is welcoming it with open arms. Sometimes I think all we can hope for is that Africans have developed some genetic resistance to COVID-19 otherwise tumekwisha.
# 7. premières campagnes de test
Sun Feb 02 - - Mohammed Hersi - - Thank God.  It is also comforting that we are now able to test locally. Thank You @MOH_Kenya  & CS Sicily.

# 8. prières
Thu Feb 27 - - C H I E F ✪ - - Dear Lord, save Kenya from incompetent & greedy politicians. May the #CoronaVirusKenya if it enters Kenya avoid the sons & daughters of the Poor & innocent citizens. Let those fearful of offending China by denying the virus exists get the evidence of its existence firsthand.
# 9. gire whistleblower
Fri Feb 28 - - Boniface Mwangi - - Gire is a whistleblower and he deserves to be celebrated not reprimanded. IF Gire hadn't shared the video we wouldn't have known that the Kenya government has allocated 11 beds only for Coronavirus patients.We are clearly under prepared if Coronavirus gets here!#JusticeForGireAli twitter.com/InsecurityKE/s… pic.twitter.com/yIpUdWtQKU

# 1. Répercussions économiques
Sun Mar 29 - - Omid Scobie - - I hope when this is over we can all rush to support tourism industries, particularly in places that depend on it. Take Kenya for example. Their entire services sector has disappeared — 63% of GDP gone. Economic instability is now more likely to end lives there than coronavirus.
Sun Mar 15 - - Ahmednasir Abdullahi SC - - Every Central Bank whether in the West, East or Middle East has reacted to the Coronavirus with a number of tools to redirect a country's economy or cushion venerable sectors but if you are a stone age economy like Kenya,just twiddle your thumb and pray @DavidNdii @WehliyeMohamed

Thu Mar 26 - - Steve Ogolla - - UNLESS you have no regard for common sense, if you don't have coronavirus you're safe: stay home, if you go out avoid body contact, &wash hands. You don't need government for that. So what's the hullabaloo about Kenya's bed capacity? Let's worry about starvation. #CurfewinKenya
Thu Mar 19 - - Nzioka Waita - - Sad to see some respectable companies in KE still on business as usual mode. @MOH_Kenya recommended safe working zones for employees through shifts & creation virtual workspaces but this is being ignored.We must all play our part in defeating #Covid19 don’t wait to be compelled.

Mon Mar 23 - - gathara - - In the same Kenya where someone was recently murdered because his killers thought he had COVID-19? How many people do you think would come forward for testing if they thought their names might end up on a death list? twitter.com/Kenyans/status…
# 8. Loyer : demande au gouvernement de les suspendre
Tue Mar 31 - - Scheaffer Okore - - Dear Government of Kenya, Rent is due next week for many many many Kenyans whose incomes have been halted due to COVID19.Kindly intervene, lead and guide on way forward. Please.

# Polémique sur le test des vaccins contre le COVID-19 au Kenya
# Adrian Blomfield = journaliste traitant de l'Afrique chez the Economist
Sat Apr 25 - - Africa Updates - - University of Oxford researchers plan to vaccinate volunteers with a COVID-19 vaccine in the UK over the next month. If the trial is successful, they will approach scientists in the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and the Govt of Kenya for permission to evaluate in Kenya pic.twitter.com/CyMJDZnc6N
Fri Apr 17 - - CABRAXAS - - Bill Gates is using Kenyans as human guinea pigs to test his "remdesivir" vaccine that will 'cure' Kenyans of Covid-19. But Gates promised to cure India of child polio, only to cripple 496,000 children with a deadly new polio strain. Pray for Kenya.kenyan-post.com/2020/04/here-i…
Fri Apr 24 - - Koitaba collins - - The despot also wants the covid-19 vaccine tested in kenya, he became first in Huduma number, let him be the first one to get the vaccine
Sat Apr 25 - - Adrian Blomfield - - There’s nothing wrong with vaccine trials. Without them there would be no vaccines. In a covid-19 trial you don’t get exposed to covid-19. The doses in the first phase are very low and gradually increased. If Kenya participates and trial succeeds, Kenya 1st in line. Win/win twitter.com/ledamalekina/s…
Sun Apr 05 - - Marisa - - I was happy to hear this news from Kenya.Senator Wetangu'la calls on African leaders to reject COVID-19 vaccine test on continent  tuko.co.ke/349783-resist-…
# Tests du COVID-19 : on en fait assez ou pas ?
Fri Apr 10 - - Dr. Mercy Mwangangi - - Kenya’s testing capacity is currently at an appx. of 600 tests per day. These numbers will be scaled up in the coming days. From today, we will move from manual testing and to automatic COVID-19 testing at KEMRI.
Thu Apr 02 - - Ja Loka - - I feel that the statistics for Covid-19 in Kenya would be worse if the government could test 1000 people daily. We are testing 300 per day and up to 10% positive cases. In a month’s time, we will only have tested 9000 people.
# Où part l'argent dédié au COVID-19 ?
Wed Apr 22 - - Sen. Ledama Olekina - - Some bellies will soon be preganant with #COVID19KE funds! How on earth would someone claim to have spent 4O Billion to combat Corona Virus in Kenya? While Kenyans are stranded in China, Lenana Wachman 40K Bill is unpaid ?  Saitan!

# Demande de transparence sur les chiffres (nb de cas, nb de tests)
Sat May 16 - - Mihr Thakar - - It is very disappointing that Kenya, on a day that it reports RECORD HIGH Covid-19 deaths & RECORD HIGH new cases, FAILS to:1. Disclose the number of samples tested in the last 24 hours2. Give a breakdown of the locations of the casesCommon @MOH_Kenya, you CAN DO BETTER!
# Human trials for covid-19 drug : qu'en pensent les citoyens ?
Wed May 06 - - Martha Karua - - We need @Mutahikagwe19 to make public the protocols governing the clinical trials of three Covid 19 drugs in kenya , further to confirm whether kenya is considering trying the herbal based cure from Madagascar @MOH_Kenya @StateHouseKenya
# Répercussions économiques
Sat May 30 - - Wambui Mbugua - - Is Kenya fighting the virus or it's people??!!We have lost jobs, livelihoods @PoliceKE  are drawing the last straw!! We can't stay silent @bonifacemwangi#JusticeForSamuelMaina
Thu May 28 - - Dictator Watch - - The number of businesses in Kenya closing down is bound to increase in the coming weeks. That's because the government of Dictator Uhuru Kenyatta mishandled the covid19 response & many businesses know the worst is yet to come. There'll be more redundancies.
